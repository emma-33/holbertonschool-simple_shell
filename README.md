###### **PROJET SIMPLE SHELL**

A shell is a program that provides a user interface to the operating system. It allows users to interact with the system by typing commands. The shell interprets these commands and executes them on behalf of the user.
When a user logs into a system, the shell is typically the first program that is started. The shell then presents the user with a prompt, which is a symbol or sequence of symbols that indicates that the shell is ready to accept a command.

The user can then type a command and press Enter. The shell will then interpret the command and execute it. If the command is successful, the shell will display the output of the command to the user. If the command is not successful, the shell will display an error message.
